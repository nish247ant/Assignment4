    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class. It allows the data to be hidden and accessed only through the defined methods, ensuring data integrity and providing control over how the data is manipulated. Encapsulation helps in achieving information hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). The derived classes inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of the base classes, allowing code reuse and promoting the concept of hierarchical relationships. Inheritance facilitates the extension and specialization of classes, leading to code organization and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways. It allows objects to take on multiple forms based on their class hierarchy. Polymorphism enhances flexibility and modularity by enabling the use of a common interface to interact with different objects, promoting code reuse and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features of an object or a system while hiding unnecessary details. It provides a simplified and generalized view of objects by defining their essential characteristics and behavior, without exposing the implementation specifics. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, reducing code duplication, and improving code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—provide a solid foundation for building modular, extensible, and maintainable software systems. They promote code reusability, organization, and flexibility, making it easier to design and develop complex applications.\"\"\""
